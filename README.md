# EvoStratClean
A simple implementation of OpenAIs work on evolutionary strategies. Original paper: [Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03864)

### Requirements ###

This implementation uses *Numpy*, *PyTorch*, and *OpenAI gym*. These can be installed easily by searching their respective names on github.

Look at ``` main.py ``` for how to start training for the BipedealWalker-v2 environment found in the OpenAI gym Box2d environments. 

### General Comments ###

This library is intended to be a straight-forward implementation of ES without parallelisation or other speed-up tricks. If you have any recommended changes please let me know.
